1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.930
<v ->There were some fans that thought</v>

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.560
I had something to do with Avengers: Endgame.

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.393
(audience laughs)

4
00:00:05.393 --> 00:00:06.226
<v Ellen>Oh, really?</v>

5
00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:07.660 line:15% 
<v ->Taylor Swift defeated Thanos?</v>

6
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.513 line:15% 
Not quite.

7
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.060
Taylor made her first appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show

8
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.120
in four years on Wednesday.

9
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.010
And opened up about how she leaves Easter eggs

10
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.730
for her Swifties in her music videos,

11
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.740
and her interviews, and basically everywhere,

12
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.270
because she loves making us lose our minds.

13
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.930
But with all that sleuthing and speculating,

14
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.710
we Swifties can't get it right every time.

15
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.210
So, Ellen asked the "Me" singer just how far off

16
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.120
her fans have been with something they thought

17
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.200
was and Easter egg, but totally wasn't.

18
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.320
T-Swift called to mind when

19
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.210
some Swifties thought she might have something to do

20
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.930
with Avengers: Endgame.

21
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.680
<v ->Because we had the single coming out the same day</v>

22
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.540
and I have a song that was called Endgame,

23
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.248
and so they were like, oh my God, she's gonna defeat Thanos.

24
00:00:43.248 --> 00:00:44.900
(audience laughs)

25
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.580
I let everyone down.
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

26
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.413
<v ->Again.</v>

27
00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:48.900
<v ->As a Swiftie, I'm just glad she didn't call us out</v>

28
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.710
for the whole five holes in the fence theory again.

29
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.090
During her appearance on the talk show,

30
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.800
Tay also played a round of burning questions.

31
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.970
Where she opened up about her favorite T.V. shows,

32
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.870
her favorite movies she saw this week,

33
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.240
and addressed one of her most memorable Ellen Show moments.

34
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.720
When the host asked Taylor about the most

35
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.960
rebellious thing she did as a teenager,

36
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.460
the singer/songwriter said this.

37
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.820 line:15% 
<v ->Probably when I like put Joe Jonas on blast on your show.</v>

38
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.653 line:15% 
(audience laughs)

39
00:01:11.653 --> 00:01:12.760 line:15% 
That was too much.

40
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.340 line:15% 
<v ->Was it?</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.620
That was too much.

42
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.230
<v ->Of course Taylor was referencing this</v>

43
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.040
iconic time in pop-culture history

44
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.560
that was, if you can believe it, 11 years ago, in 2008.

45
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.570
<v ->And when I look at that person,</v>

46
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.980
I'm not even gonna be able to remember

47
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.810
the boy who broke up with me over the phone

48
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.503
in 25 seconds when I was 18.

49
00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:30.470
(audience gasps)

50
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.200
<v ->Ooh, the shade was so real then.</v>

51
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.090
But, Tay admitted she and the Jonas Brother

52
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.121
can laugh about it now.

53
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:35.979
♪ I promise that you'll never ♪

54
00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.470
♪ Find another like me-e-e ♪

55
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.350
<v ->All right for the full clips</v>

56
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.240
from Taylor's appearance on Ellen, head to thr.com.

57
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.210
Until next time, for The Hollywood Reporter News,

58
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.223
I'm Tiffany Taylor.

59
00:01:46.316 --> 00:01:48.619
(upbeat music)
